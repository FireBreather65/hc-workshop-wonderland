## Inspiration
This project was originally created at a workshop during [Wonderland](https://wonderland.hackclub.com/), a 48-hour hackathon hosted in Boston. I decided to continue working on it after the workshop to improve the design and functionality, and this is the result 😁

## Features
As the demo video shows, you can chat with the bot! Your goal is to figure out the secret password 🤫

## Technologies
This website was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my end, with the bot being provided by [this repo](https://github.com/hackclub/wizard-orpheus).

## Challenges and accomplishments
Due to my inexperience with JS, I faced a lot of issues with that, most notably trying to color the messages based on the sender. It was when I realized that there was HTML being dynamically created for each message that I was able to work through it 🙂

## What I learned
I learned a lot about JavaScript during this project! For example, I had to create functions give the buttons functionality.

## Future plans
I have a lot of ideas for future implementations, such as allowing the narrator to reprimand bad behavior or changing the secret password after each game.
